# Travelling Salesperson
The travelling salesperson is a mathematical problem where the following is asked: "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?". The problem is described further here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem

# The repo
In this repository you find two different apporaches of solving the problem; the brute force method and using a genetic algorithm. The first one checks all possible combinations while the other uses a random start state and then "genetically" gets better each iteration from mutations. Read more in the attached "Process.png" about the genetic algorithm process.
